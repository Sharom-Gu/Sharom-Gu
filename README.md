My name is Sharom, and I currently serve as the Technical Service Lead in the Open Banking PSD2 API division at Qwist. In my role at Qwist, I not only have the opportunity to work with cutting-edge technologies in practice but also immerse myself in the world of API documentation and computer languages.

The daily exposure to various API documentations has sparked my interest in this field, prompting me to deepen my knowledge. Currently, I am enrolled in the Python Bootcamp: Master Python Programming in 2024 on Udemy. This decision is rooted in the desire to expand my programming skills and become familiar with one of the most versatile and powerful languages.

While I am still at the beginning of my journey, I am particularly fascinated by the field of Data Science. The prospect of analyzing complex data, identifying patterns, and making informed decisions excites me. Although I am yet to determine the specific area of specialization, I am determined to further my knowledge and evolve in this exciting field.

I am eager to see what exciting challenges and learning opportunities the future holds for me as I deepen my expertise in Data Science while concurrently contributing in my role as the Technical Service Lead at Qwist.
